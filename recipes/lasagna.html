  <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sweet Italian Sausage</li>
    <li>Ground Beef</li>
    <li>White Wine</li>
    <li>Ricotta Cheese</li>
    <li>Sliced Mozzarella</li>
    <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Chopped Parsley</li>
    <li>Tomato paste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
  <p>In a large pot over medium heat, add in ground sausage and ground beef. Use a spoon to break up the meat into small
    pieces. Add in onion and garlic and cook until meat is well browned, stirring constantly. Stir in sugar, fresh
    basil, fennel, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup chopped parsley. Pour in crushed tomatoes, tomato
    paste, tomato sauce, and wine*. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer 1-4 hours* (see
    notes), stirring occasionally.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into the bottom of a 9x13 pan. Pour hot tap water directly over the noodles,
    making sure the pasta is completely immersed in the water. Let them soak for 30 minutes, then drain and discard
    water.
    In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg.
    Refrigerate until ready to assemble lasagna.</p>
  <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a deep dish 9x13 or lasagna pan*.
    To assemble, spread about 1 cup of meat sauce in the prepared lasagna pan, just enough to cover the bottom. Place 4
    lasagna sheets on top. Spread with 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture on top of the pasta. Top with 1/4 of mozzarella
    cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, then sprinkle with 1/4 cup parmesan cheese.</p>
  <p>Repeat layering two more times with pasta, ricotta, mozzarella, meat sauce, then parmesan cheese, creating three
    complete layers.</p>
  <p>To finish, place a final layer of pasta sheets. Then spread 1 cup of meat sauce to cover the pasta and keep it from
    drying out. Top with remaining mozzarella slices and the remaining parmesan cheese.</p>
  <p>Cover the pan loosely with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an
    additional
    25 minutes to allow cheese to brown. Serve hot.</p>
