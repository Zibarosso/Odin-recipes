  <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
  <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</p>
  <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix well.</p>
  <p>Add the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Beat on medium speed for about 2
    minutes until well combined.</p>
  <p>Stir in the boiling water until the batter is smooth. The batter will be thin.</p>
  <p>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans.</p>
  <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>
  <p>Let the cakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then remove them from the pans and transfer to wire racks to
    cool completely.</p>
  <p>Once cooled, frost with your favorite chocolate frosting and enjoy!</p>
